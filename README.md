For this assignment, you will write a C#
solution
called
HousePaintingLastName (where you will replace
“LastName” with your lastname)
.
The program will enable the user to specify
the dimensions of the
rooms of the house they want to paint. For each room, the program will ask the user for the length,
width, and height of the room, whether or not they want to use primer, and whether or not they want
to paint the ceiling. At the end,
the program will show them the total square footage they will be
painting and the total number of gallons of paint and primer required. You can assume that paint covers
400 square feet per gallon and primer covers 250 square feet per gallon.
